# V-LordChess

> A chess game with VueJs!

## Backlog

> Apply state management and use it for track game turns
> Apply movement exceptions such as Rook and Large Rook
> Apply rules for pieces (which are the possible squares that the pieces can move and block in case of not possible)
> Place grid at boardside ([1,2,3] & [a,b,c])
> Develop interface (think about responsability and touch support? idk, maybe)
> Create your own board piece placement (for training purposes)
> Implement more skins (or even make it more visually apealling)
